# Story 1.5: API Documentation Enhancement with Example Payloads

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer or tester,
**I want to** have comprehensive example request and response bodies in the API documentation,
**so that** I can easily test and integrate with the service endpoints without guesswork.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All POST endpoints have valid, realistic example request bodies in OpenAPI/Swagger documentation.
2. All PUT endpoints have complete update example payloads showing all possible fields.
3. Example responses show actual data structure including proper handling of BigInt and Decimal fields.
4. The Swagger UI displays these examples and allows direct testing of the API.
5. Examples include both minimal required fields and comprehensive full payloads.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Install and configure Swagger UI dependencies (AC: 4)
  - [x] Ensure @nestjs/swagger is installed (already done in story 1.4)
  - [x] Configure SwaggerModule in main.ts if not already done

  - [x] Enable "Try it out" functionality in Swagger UI

- [x] Enhance Provider endpoints documentation (AC: 1, 2, 3, 5)
  - [x] Add @ApiBody decorator to POST /providers with example payload

  - [x] Provide full service example (with description, image, price range)
  - [x] Add @ApiBody decorator to PUT /providers/:id/catalogue/:catalogueId
  - [x] Add response examples showing Decimal price conversion

  - [x] Add troubleshooting section for common issues

## Dev Notes

### Example Payloads to Implement

**Provider Creation (POST /providers)**
```json
// Minimal example
{
  "serviceTypeId": 1
}

// Comprehensive example
{
  "serviceTypeId": 3,
  "lat": "40.7128",
  "lng": "-74.0060",
  "advancePayType": "percent",
  "advanceValue": 25,
  "hasCancellation": true,
  "cancellationTime": 1440,
  "capacity": 3
}
```

**Business Hours (POST /providers/:id/business-hours)**
```json
// Monday-Friday schedule
{
  "dayOfWeek": 1,
  "openTime": "09:00",
  "closeTime": "17:00",
  "isClosed": false
}

// Sunday closed
{
  "dayOfWeek": 0,
  "isClosed": true,
  "openTime": "00:00",
  "closeTime": "00:00"
}
```

**Service Catalogue (POST /providers/:id/catalogue)**
```json
// Minimal service
{
  "title": "Basic Haircut",
  "price": 25.00,
  "duration": 30,
  "durationType": "minute"
}

// Full service details
{
  "title": "Premium Hair Styling Package",
  "description": "Complete hair styling service including wash, cut, style, and treatment",
  "price": 75.00,
  "isPriceRange": 1,
  "rangePrice": 150.00,
  "duration": 2,
  "durationType": "hour",
  "currency": "USD",
  "serveCapacity": 1,
  "image": "https://example.com/service-image.jpg"
}
```

**Search Query Examples (GET /api/v1/services/search/services)**
```
// By location only
?lat=40.7128&lng=-74.0060

// By service type only
?serviceTypeId=3

// Combined search
?serviceTypeId=3&lat=40.7128&lng=-74.0060&keyword=haircut

// Keyword search only
?keyword=premium
```

### Swagger Decorators to Use

**Required Decorators:**
- `@ApiTags()` - Group endpoints by module
- `@ApiOperation()` - Describe what endpoint does
- `@ApiBody()` - Document request body with examples
- `@ApiResponse()` - Document possible responses
- `@ApiQuery()` - Document query parameters
- `@ApiParam()` - Document path parameters
- `@ApiProperty()` - In DTOs for field descriptions

**Example Implementation:**
```typescript
@Post()
@ApiOperation({
  summary: 'Create a new service provider',
  description: 'Creates a provider profile with business location and settings'
})
@ApiBody({
  description: 'Provider creation data',
  examples: {
    minimal: {
      summary: 'Minimal required fields',
      value: { serviceTypeId: 1 }
    },
    complete: {
      summary: 'All fields populated',
      value: { /* full example */ }
    }
  }
})
@ApiResponse({
  status: 201,
  description: 'Provider created successfully',
  schema: { example: { /* response */ } }
})
```

### Response Format Standards

All responses should show:
- BigInt fields as strings (id: "123")
- Decimal fields as numbers (price: 25.00)
- Timestamps in ISO format
- Consistent field naming (camelCase)
- Null vs undefined handling

### Testing Workflow Documentation

Document the typical user journey:
1. Create provider account (POST /providers)
2. Set business hours for each day (POST /providers/:id/business-hours)
3. Add services to catalogue (POST /providers/:id/catalogue)
4. Search for services (GET /search/services)
5. Update service details (PUT /providers/:id/catalogue/:id)
6. Manage capacity and settings (PUT /providers/:id)

### Technical Requirements

**Existing Infrastructure:**
- @nestjs/swagger already installed (from Story 1.4)
- Controllers use class-validator DTOs
- Swagger configuration may need enhancement in main.ts

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/main.ts` - Swagger configuration
- `src/modules/providers/providers.controller.ts`
- `src/modules/business-hours/business-hours.controller.ts`
- `src/modules/service-catalogue/service-catalogue.controller.ts`
- `src/modules/service-catalogue/search.controller.ts`
- All DTO files - add @ApiProperty decorators

**New Files:**
- `docs/API_TESTING.md` - Testing guide
- `postman/lubyc-service-core.postman_collection.json` - API collection

### Testing Requirements

**Manual Testing:**
- Verify Swagger UI loads at /api-docs
- Test "Try it out" functionality for each endpoint
- Confirm examples are selectable in dropdown
- Validate example payloads actually work

**Automated Testing:**
- Ensure decorators don't break existing tests
- Verify documentation generates without errors
- Test that examples match DTO validation rules

# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

*   **Revenue Expansion:** Generate revenue for Lubyc through commissions on paid bookings and the introduction of premium provider tiers.
*   **Create a Stickier Ecosystem:** Increase user retention by providing a single platform that handles learning, events, and personal appointments.
*   **Enable Cross-Module Synergies:** Allow service providers to promote their services in the Social feed, upsell during Events, and communicate with clients via Messaging.
*   **Empower the Local Economy:** Enable micro-entrepreneurs (such as beauticians, tutors, and medics) to monetize their skills instantly within their communities.

## Background Context

Lubycâ€™s vision is to offer a single digital workspace for all business and community operations. A critical missing piece in this vision is real-time service scheduling. This project will introduce the capability for any Lubyc user to publish their availability, define their services, and accept bookings with integrated payments. This closes a significant gap in the platform, moving Lubyc closer to its goal of being a truly all-in-one solution.
